# Projects:

These are various projects I've worked on over the last few years, some for student organizations in high school and college, and some on my own time.

## Internships:

### [San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) RDS Summer Internship](https://sdsc-ucsd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SRSI21/pages/1834254338/SU21+SDSC+RDS+Summer+Internship+Home)
#### [tarocard](https://github.com/DylanB5402/tarocard)

Timeline: June 2021 - September 2021

The RDS internship with SDSC was my first formal internship experience. I worked alongside a [team](https://sdsc-ucsd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SRSI21/pages/1834254730/SU21+Team+AhjinTpCc) of 6 other developers to develop a simple social media web application. I worked primarily as a backend developer, working on the server-side and database code, using technologies such as Javascript, Express, and SQLite. Our team spent the first week learning about Agile development and brainstorming our product. The next 2 weeks (the first sprint) was spent learning relevant technologies, during which I learned to use npm and Express, along with reviewing my Javascript and SQL. After this, we spent about 7 weeks properly developing the webapp, the last few days being spent testing and presenting our app.

## Personal Projects:

### [dylanb5402.github.io](https://github.com/DylanB5402/dylanb5402.github.io)

Timeline: April 2021 - Present

While I'd been planning on making this website for a while, I only started working on a personal website in April 2021. A previous iteration of this site was made using React and React-Bootstrap. However, I switched to using Jekyll for this site so I could focus more on the content of this site than on frontend development. 

### [PersonalPlanner](https://github.com/DylanB5402/PersonalPlanner)

Timeline: September 2020

PersonalPlanner was made to automate setting up my Notion board/to-do list each quarter using the Notion API. I add a quarter and what time I have each class, and Notion autopopulates the calendar. 

### [StupidSummerProject](https://github.com/DylanB5402/StupidSummerProject)

Timeline: June 2019 - September 2019

A Python script wrapping [Fanficfare](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare) to download webfiction and automatically send it to my Kindle.

### [SummerProject2](https://github.com/DylanB5402/SummerProject2/commits/master)

Timeline: June 2020 - July 2020

An Android app for downloading fanfiction from various sites and sending them directly to a Kindle device written in Python using Kivy. The backend uses FanFicFare and fiction from any site supported by FanFicFare can be downloaed. Mobi files are sent over email using SMTP. 

### [ColorMean](https://github.com/DylanB5402/ColorMean)

Timeline: July 2020

A Python script to "pixelify" images, made while I was bored and interested in working with OpenCV.

## FIRST Robotics Competition Projects:

The vast majority of software I wrote during High School was for my school's FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team ([687 - The Nerd Herd](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/687)).

### [PowerUp2018](https://github.com/nerdherd/PowerUp2018Offseason)

Also see: [https://github.com/nerdherd/PowerUp2018](https://github.com/nerdherd/PowerUp2018)

Timeline: January 2018 - October 2018

While I joined my school's FRC team in the 2017 season, I didn't become involved with the software for a competition robot until 2018. [Diplo](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/687/2018) was the first competition robot I worked on software for. I assisted in the development of Diplo's code, featuring closed loop control of a 2 degree-of-freedom robotic arm and autonomous path following.

### [DeepSpace2019](https://github.com/nerdherd/DeepSpace2019)

Timeline: January 2019 - October 2019

[Gigantor](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/687/2019) was the first robot I wrote code for as a Programming Lead on the team. While writing Gigantor's code, our team also wrote a [software binder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GWe93W186P_5ae7Ai7O43S8fEdd6IMaK/view?usp=sharing) describing some of the technology behind the software more in-depth. Our team won the Innovation in Control and Autonomous awards at the regional level for our software in 2019.

### [InfiniteRecharge2020](https://github.com/nerdherd/InfiniteRecharge2020)

Timeline: January 2020 - March 2020

[Thomas](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/687/2020) was the second robot I worked on as a Programming Lead. More information on its code is available in the repo's README.

### [NerdyScout](https://github.com/nerdherd/NerdyScoutBlitz)

In FRC, teams often "scout" other robots by recording quantitative data on their performance to determine which robots to play alongside in playoff matches. NerdyScout was a scouting system meant to automate large amounts of the task. Scouts record data on robots using a Google Form. NerdyScout scraped the data from the form's corresponding Google Sheet, analyzed it, and output relevant metrics to another Google Sheet. 

Timeline: October 2019 - March 2020

### [NerdyLib](https://github.com/nerdherd/NerdyLib)

Timeline: January 2019 - March 2020

NerdyLib was our team's year and robot agnostic software library. It contained all the abstractions that were identical across different robots. For example, every robot we made had a similar drivetrain, so all code relating to the drive could be abstracted away in NerdyLib. The biggest reason I started NerdyLib was because I was getting tired of copy/pasting identical code between the repos for multiple robots.

### [Drivetrain Simulation](https://github.com/DylanB5402/RobotDriveTrainSim)

[https://github.com/DylanB5402/DrivetrainSim](https://github.com/DylanB5402/DrivetrainSim)

Timeline: April 2018 - December 2018

Lacking access to a physical robot at home, I put together a simple physics simulation of a differential drivetrain similar to those frequently seen in FRC to experiment with various pathfollowing algorithms.
